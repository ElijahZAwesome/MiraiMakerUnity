# MiraiMakerUnity
A project that aims to recreate all the main mechanics of Project Mirai DX for the 3DS.
User made levels is the focus, with plans to make editing good enough to build levels just as good as ones built into the game, ala Clone Hero

I've never made a rhythm game, so i'm mostly just learning from this.

# License
All rights for the sprites and music go to SEGA or their respective creators, I intend to remake them in HD if the game gets to a playable state.
