# MiraiMakerUnity
A project that aims to recreate all the main mechanics of Project Mirai DX for the 3DS.
User made levels is the focus, with plans to make editing good enough to build levels just as good as ones built into the game, ala Clone Hero

I've never made a rhythm game, so i'm mostly just learning from this.

# Status
While I loved working on this, the complexities of it are frying my brain, and I can't keep working on it for the life of me.

Please, feel free to carry on the torch, or make PRs so I can continue. I like where this is going, I just don't have the knowledge to get it there.

# License
All rights for the sprites and music go to SEGA or their respective creators, I intend to remake them in HD if the game gets to a playable state.
